# To-do list project.

_This is my first javascript assignment for Javascript course at Medie Institutet._

Use my existing knowledge in javascript to make a page that handles To-dos. The page should show a number of points to be done. These should then appear on the screen in the form of a list. When the task is completed, the user must be able to mark the task as completed and the task must then be removed from the list.
