# To-do list project.

_This is my first javascript assignment for Javascript course at Medie Institutet._

Use my existing knowledge in javascript to make a page that handles To-dos. The page should show a number of items to be done. These should then appear on the screen in the form of a list. When the task is completed, the user must be able to mark the task as completed. When the user wishes, the task must be able to removed from the list.

## Project Structure

The nameing of variables and functions are to use camelCase. For example:

let toDoInput = "name";

function removeTodo();

Class names are to always start with a capital letter. For example:

class Todo {

}
